  title: "About Invertis Innovation & Incubation",
  description: `Invertis Innovation and Incubation (III) is a dynamic hub designed to nurture and accelerate entrepreneurial ventures within the Invertis University ecosystem. It is an independent organisation which provides a platform for budding entrepreneurs, students, and faculty to transform innovative ideas into successful businesses. 

Incubation is an important activity whose value lies in its ability to help bridge the gap between an idea and the market. III acts as a business incubator that provides fledgling ventures with workspace, seed funding, mentoring, and networking opportunities.

Unlike accelerators that focus on speeding up growth for existing start-ups, incubators support early-stage ventures. They create an ecosystem conducive to innovation, where students can work on their start-up ideas while completing their academics. III at Invertis University has built a strong ecosystem with many avenues for start-ups to solve real-world problems. These avenues include events, competitions, guest lectures, industry connect, mentorship programs and many more.`,
  vision: "To create a dynamic space where creativity meets opportunity, guiding startups through every stage from initial concept to successful execution.",
  mission: "To cultivate a culture of entrepreneurship, offering world-class support to innovators, helping them turn their vision into reality while contributing to sustainable development and economic growth.",
